	<h1> By default, Tailwind removes all of the default browser styling from</h1>
	<p class="lead">
		Until now, trying to style an article, document, or blog post with
		Tailwind has been a tedious task that required a keen eye for
		typography and a lot of complex custom CSS.
	</p>
	<p>
		By default, Tailwind removes all of the default browser styling from
		paragraphs, headings, lists and more. This ends up being really
		useful for building application UIs because you spend less time
		undoing user-agent styles, but when you <em>really are</em> just
		trying to style some content that came from a rich-text editor in a
		CMS or a markdown file, it can be surprising and unintuitive.

	<p>
		We get lots of complaints about it actually, with people regularly
		asking us things like:
	</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p class="text-inovahc-800">
		Why is Tailwind removing the default styles on my
		<code>h1</code> elements? How do I disable this? What do you mean
		I lose all the other base styles too?
		</p>
	</blockquote>
	<pre>
		<code class="language-html">
		For years parents have espoused the health benefits of eating garlic bread with cheese to their
		children, with the food earning such an iconic status in our culture that kids will often dress
		up as warm, cheesy loaf for Halloween.
		
		But a recent study shows that the celebrated appetizer may be linked to a series of rabies cases
		springing up around the country.

		</code>
	</pre>
	<p>
		We hear you, but we're not convinced that simply disabling our base
		styles is what you really want. You don't want to have to remove
		annoying margins every time you use a <code>p</code> element in a
		piece of your dashboard UI. And I doubt you really want your blog
		posts to use the user-agent styles either â€” you want them to look
		<em>awesome</em>, not awful.
	</p>
	<p>
		The <code>@tailwindcss/typography</code> plugin is our attempt to
		give you what you <em>actually</em> want, without any of the
		downsides of doing something stupid like disabling our base styles.
	</p>
	<p>
		It adds a new <code>prose</code> class that you can slap on any
		block of vanilla HTML content and turn it into a beautiful,
		well-formatted document:
	</p>

	<p>Hopefully that looks good enough to you.</p>
	<h3>What about nested lists?</h3>
	<p>
		Nested lists basically always look bad which is why editors like
		Medium don't even let you do it, but I guess since some of you
		goofballs are going to do it we have to carry the burden of at least
		making it work.
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>
		<strong>Nested lists are rarely a good idea.</strong>
		<ul>
			<li>
			You might feel like you are being really "organized" or
			something but you are just creating a gross shape on the
			screen that is hard to read.
			</li>
			<li>
			Nested navigation in UIs is a bad idea too, keep things as
			flat as possible.
			</li>
			<li>
			Nesting tons of folders in your source code is also not
			helpful.
			</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
		<strong>
			Since we need to have more items, here's another one.
		</strong>
		<ul>
			<li>
			I'm not sure if we'll bother styling more than two levels
			deep.
			</li>
			<li>
			Two is already too much, three is guaranteed to be a bad idea.
			</li>
			<li>If you nest four levels deep you belong in prison.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
		<strong>
			Two items isn't really a list, three is good though.
		</strong>
		<ul>
			<li>
			Again please don't nest lists if you want people to actually
			read your content.
			</li>
			<li>Nobody wants to look at this.</li>
			<li>I'm upset that we even have to bother styling this.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
		The most annoying thing about lists in Markdown is that
		<code>&lt;li&gt;</code> elements aren't given a child
		<code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tag unless there are multiple paragraphs in
		the list item. That means I have to worry about styling that
		annoying situation too.
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
		<p><strong>For example, here's another nested list.</strong></p>
		<p>But this time with a second paragraph.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>These list items won't have <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tags</li>
			<li>Because they are only one line each</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p>
			<strong>
			But in this second top-level list item, they will.
			</strong>
		</p>
		<p>
			This is especially annoying because of the spacing on this
			paragraph.
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
			<p>
				As you can see here, because I've added a second line, this
				list item now has a
				<code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tag.
			</p>
			<p>This is the second line I'm talking about by the way.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p>
				Finally here's another list item so it's more like a list.
			</p>
			</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p>
			A closing list item, but with no nested list, because why not?
		</p>
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>And finally a sentence to close off this section.</p>
	<h2>There are other elements we need to style</h2>
	<p>
		I almost forgot to mention links, like
		<a href="https://tailwindcss.com">
		this link to the Tailwind CSS website
		</a>
		. We almost made them blue but that's so yesterday, so we went with
		dark gray, feels edgier.
	</p>
	<p>We even included table styles, check it out:</p>
	<table>
		<thead>
		<tr>
			<th>Wrestler</th>
			<th>Origin</th>
			<th>Finisher</th>
		</tr>
		</thead>
		<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>Bret "The Hitman" Hart</td>
			<td>Calgary, AB</td>
			<td>Sharpshooter</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Stone Cold Steve Austin</td>
			<td>Austin, TX</td>
			<td>Stone Cold Stunner</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Randy Savage</td>
			<td>Sarasota, FL</td>
			<td>Elbow Drop</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Vader</td>
			<td>Boulder, CO</td>
			<td>Vader Bomb</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Razor Ramon</td>
			<td>Chuluota, FL</td>
			<td>Razor's Edge</td>
		</tr>
		</tbody>
	</table>
	<p>
		We also need to make sure inline code looks good, like if I wanted
		to talk about
		<code>&lt;span&gt;</code> elements or tell you the good news about
		<code>@tailwindcss/typography</code>.
	</p>
	<h3>Sometimes I even use <code>code</code> in headings</h3>
	<p>
		Even though it's probably a bad idea, and historically I've had a
		hard time making it look good. This
		<em>"wrap the code blocks in backticks"</em> trick works pretty well
		though really.
	</p>
	<p>
		Another thing I've done in the past is put a <code>code</code> tag
		inside of a link, like if I wanted to tell you about the
		<a href="https://github.com/tailwindcss/docs">
		<code>tailwindcss/docs</code>
		</a>
		repository. I don't love that there is an underline below the
		backticks but it is absolutely not worth the madness it would
		require to avoid it.
	</p>
	<h4>We haven't used an <code>h4</code> yet</h4>
	<p>
		But now we have. Please don't use <code>h5</code> or
		<code>h6</code> in your content, Medium only supports two heading
		levels for a reason, you animals. I honestly considered using a
		<code>before</code> pseudo-element to scream at you if you use an
		<code>h5</code> or <code>h6</code>.
	</p>
	<p>
		We don't style them at all out of the box because
		<code>h4</code> elements are already so small that they are the same
		size as the body copy. What are we supposed to do with an
		<code>h5</code>, make it <em>smaller</em> than the body copy? No
		thanks.
	</p>
	<h3>We still need to think about stacked headings though.</h3>
	<h4>
		Let's make sure we don't screw that up with
		<code>h4</code> elements, either.
	</h4>
	<p>
		Phew, with any luck we have styled the headings above this text and
		they look pretty good.
	</p>
	<p>
		Let's add a closing paragraph here so things end with a decently
		sized block of text. I can't explain why I want things to end that
		way but I have to assume it's because I think things will look weird
		or unbalanced if there is a heading too close to the end of the
		document.
	</p>
	<p>
		What I've written here is probably long enough, but adding this
		final sentence can't hurt.
	</p>
